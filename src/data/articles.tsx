          "With a length that can reach approximately 3 meters and a weight exceeding 70kg, the Komodo Dragon, scientifically known as Varanus Komodoensis, stands as the largest lizard and reptile on Earth. Recognizable by their immense size, flat heads, bowed legs, lengthy thick tails, and forked tongues, these dragons exhibit remarkable physical features. Capable of reaching speeds up to 20kph on land and displaying adept swimming skills, Komodos possess excellent vision, allowing them to perceive objects from a distance of 300 meters. Functioning as formidable predators, these carnivores can consume up to 80% of their body weight in a single feeding. Their diet includes substantial prey like water buffaloes, deer, carrion, pigs, and, notably, even humans. Employing a distinctive hunting technique, especially against large prey like water buffaloes, Komodos encircle their victim, patiently waiting for the slow-acting venom in their saliva to take effect. Once incapacitated, the prey is torn apart and devoured entirely, bones included. If the prey manages to escape, it often succumbs within 24 hours due to the poisonous and bacteria-laden saliva.",
          "Exclusive to the Komodo National Park and the surrounding Flores island, these Jurassic and majestic creatures stand as the park's star attraction. While witnessing them is awe-inspiring, visitors are strongly advised to maintain a safe distance and exercise caution. It is imperative to be accompanied by a ranger and adhere to all given instructions when in proximity to these potentially dangerous lizards, despite their seemingly docile appearance.",

      "One of the must-visit attractions for tourists in Komodo National Park (KNP), West Manggarai Regency, Flores, East Nusa Tenggara, is the Pink Beach. Beyond offering views of the beautiful and crystal-clear blue sea, the stretch of pink-hued sand is the distinctive allure of Pink Beach.",
      "Travel Blogger Kadek Arini explained that behind the captivating sand color lies the role of waves dragging coral reefs to the shore. \"The coral reefs at Pink Beach are mostly pink. When the waves hit them, they break. The fragments, mixed with white sand, result in the pink-colored sand,\" she stated during a virtual press conference on \"Comprehensive Protection of Affordable Spirit and Health\" on Monday, December 21, 2020.",
      "According to information from Bobo on Monday, July 15, 2019, the beach's sand color on Komodo Island originates from microorganisms called foraminifera. Additionally, citing Kompas.com on Monday, September 14, 2020, foram or Foraminifera is a microscopic plankton that dates back nearly a billion years in the ocean.",
      "So, what is the connection between plankton and the sand color at Pink Beach?",

          "Although foram is said to cause the sand to turn pink, as per Tribun Travel on Sunday, August 5, 2018, the sand color is influenced by shell fragments. These broken shell fragments are carried by the waves to the coastal areas. The shell fragments then mix with the white sand from the limestone rocks around the beach.",
